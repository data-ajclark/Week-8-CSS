    Here in this site you will learn about the different types of sushi as well as a little history about each dish.
    <br><br>
    Sushi refers to a dish of various fillings encased in vinegared rice. In the modern world, sushi has become a form of fast food that is strongly associated with Japanese cuisine.
    <br><br>
    Originally sushi was developed in Southeast Asia between the 5th and 3rd centuries BC as a way of preserving raw fish in fermented rice. Gutted and salted fish wrapped in fermented rice was stored for months without spoiling. The practice spread to south China before being introduced to Japan around the 8th century.
    <br><br>
    The early form of sushi became an important source of protein for the Japanese. In those days sushi formed an integral part of celebrations during feast days and festivals when it was copiously consumed.
    <br><br>
    At first, the fermented rice was discarded and only the fish eaten, known as 'narezushi'. However, because the Japanese enjoyed eating rice with fish, a type of sushi dish called namanari became very popular during the Muromachi period.
    <br><br>
    Sushi was no longer used solely as a preservation method but rather became a new form of Japanese cuisine.
